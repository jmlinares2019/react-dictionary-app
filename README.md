# React Wiktionary

Welcome to my Wiktionary project! This app is built using `React` over `Vite` and uses the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) for its results.

Please be my guest and use the top right searchbar to search for words to get their different meanings, pronunciations, synonyms and antonyms (if available from the API).
